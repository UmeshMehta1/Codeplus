The plugin converts Cyrillic, Georgian links, filenames into Latin. It is necessary for correct work of WordPress plugins and improve links readability.

== Description ==

Transliteration is the transformation of one character into another, for example Cyrillic characters, into Latin. Usually transliteration is used to improve the readability of permalinks and avoid problems with displaying and reading files, because everything in network based on the Latin alphabet. Many plugins made by English-speaking developers do not optimize under the Cyrillic alphabet and can work unstable.

Cyrlitera transliteration plugin replaces Cyrillic, Georgian characters at posts, pages and tags to create readable permalinks. Also this plugin fixes incorrect file names and removes unnecessary characters, which can cause problems when accessing this file.

**Cyrillic link example:**<br>
_site.dev/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80

**Converted into the Latin alphabet:**<br>
_site.dev/privet-mir

In the first case, you can not visually understand the text of encoded link. In the second case, the link transliteration is implemented, everything looks more clear and the link is more shorter.

**An example of incorrect filename transliteration:**<br>
%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B5_image_ 290.jpg<br>
A+nice+picture.png

**Images transliteration example:**<br>
moe_image_ 290.jpg<br>
a-nice-picture.png

If you ignore file names creation rules, then you can get 404 errors and broken links.

Therefore, create file names using Latin characters and numbers, avoiding special characters, except dashes and underscores. Alternatively, use this plugin. It will do all this work automatically when uploading a file via the WordPress interface and reduce the number of broken links.
