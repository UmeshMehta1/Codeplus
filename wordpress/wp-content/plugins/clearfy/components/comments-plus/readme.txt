Allows administrators to disable comments on their website. Comments can be disabled according to Post, Page, Media type.

== Description ==

<strong>Disable comments</strong> plugin is a useful tool for blog or site administrators that allows fully disabling or hiding comments for any post types, pages or attachments.

It removes the all comments related features and options:

* <strong>disable comments</strong> on frontend at all;
* <strong>remove comments</strong> option from WordPress dashboard menu;
* <strong>hide comments</strong> option from the admin bar;
* <strong>Turn off comments widgets.</strong>

In addition, this plugin can <strong>disable XML-RPC</strong> related functions in WordPress including disable pingbacks and disable trackbacks, and helps to prevent the attacks on the xmlrpc.php file. Lastly, it attempts to generate a “403 Denied” error for requests to the /xmlrpc.php URL, but does not affect that file or your server in any way.

If you want <strong>completely remove comments</strong>, you can do this individually for selected post types. You can easily bulk delete all WordPress comments in some clicks. No any other “Delete All Comments” plugins or phpMyAdmin needed.

You can disable comments but if you decide to leave them, you need to close comments external links from the search engines. By default when users places comments, the WordPress adds rel=”nofollow” attribute to the comment author URL and for all links in the comments text. However, already for a long time, search engines ignores this and follows links. It makes dozens of superfluous external links from comments that are do not bring anything good for your SEO. <strong>Disable Comments</strong> plugin makes all external links in WordPress comments invisible for search engines with Javascript and improves your blog or website SEO.

In addition, if you do not want to disable comments you may need to remove website field from the WordPress comment form. Note: you can remove comment author URL but this feature can be not work with some themes.

Generally, the <strong>Disable Comments</strong> plugin uses the intelligent algorithm to <strong>hide comments</strong> and <strong>remove comments</strong>. You just need to turn some toggles on.

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions with <strong>Disable Comments</strong>, please use the plugin support forum. I cannot fix them if I do not know about! Please check the FAQ for common issues.
